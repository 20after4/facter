This package is largely meant to be a library for collecting facts about your
system.  These facts are mostly strings (i.e., not numbers), and are things
like the output of 'uname', public ssh and cfengine keys, the number of
processors, etc.

It currently cannot collect very much information, but it is architected to be
both OS and OS version specific.

See bin/facter or http://reductivelabs.com/trac/enhost for an example of the
interface.
