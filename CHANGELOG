1.1.1:
    Fixed a bug that occurs when you ask for the value of an unregistered
    fact.

1.1.0:
    Added support for OpenBSD (and probably NetBSD and FreeBSD), and significantly
    refactored (heh) how facts and resolution mechanisms are added.

1.0.2:
    Added SuSE distro
    Added initial support for Cygwin, thanks to contributions from Eric Sorenson

1.0.1:
    Added 'id' fact, which basically returns 'whoami'.

1.0:
    Rewrote entirely.  It's much simpler to use, and now supports
    adding new fact resolution mechanisms at run-time.

1.0b1:
	Initial release.
